# Specification Quality Checklist: Plateforme d'Annonces Immobilières ImmoG

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items are complete. The specification is comprehensive, technology-agnostic, and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Key Strengths**:
- 6 prioritized user stories with independent test scenarios
- 75 detailed functional requirements organized by category
- 17 measurable success criteria (all technology-agnostic)
- 8 edge cases identified with handling strategies
- 9 key entities well-defined
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all requirements are clear and unambiguous)

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate the implementation plan
